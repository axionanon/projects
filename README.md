# secret cipher ARG
I created a small ARG (online scavenger hunt) so users can interact with my cipher guestbook python project on the web.
First clue below <br> <br>

Two words in one — a single name <br>
Point to a user, let’s start the game.<br>

The first arrives when hands align,<br>
No sun remains, no church bells chime. <br>
The world is still, the hour late—<br>
A time which strikes long after eight.<br>

The second wears a cap, he works the floor, <br>
He guides the guests, guards lobby door.<br>
With a ding and he jumps near—<br>
Who stands in uniform right here?<br>

Where pictures linger and stories fade,<br>
Search where many squares are laid.
