# secret cipher ARG
I created a small ARG (online scavenger hunt) so users can interact with my cipher guestbook python project on the web.
If you'd like to play, start here:

<i>Two words in one — a single name<br>
Point to a user, let’s start the game.<br>

The first arrives when hands align,<br>
 No sun remains, no church bells chime.<br>
 The world is still, the hour late— A shadow slips past lobby gate.<br>

The second wears a cap, he works the floor, <br>
He guides the guests and shuts the door. <br>
With a ding and he jumps near— Who stands in uniform right here?<br>

Where pictures linger and stories fade,<br>
Search where many squares are laid.<br> </i>

Good luck.
