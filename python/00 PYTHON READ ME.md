<h3>Python Inspired ARG</h3>
Got a little overzealous and turned my secret cipher guestbook into an ARG so users can at least interact with the project on the web. Requires no IDE or python installed locally. 
If you'd like to play, start here:
<br>
Two words in one — a single name <br>
Point to a user, let’s start the game.<br>
<br>
The first arrives when hands align, No sun remains, no church bells chime. The world is still, the hour late— A shadow slips past lobby gate.<br>
<br>
The second wears a cap, he works the floor, He guides the guests and shuts the door. With a ding and he jumps near— Who stands in uniform right here?<br>
<br>
Where pictures linger and stories fade,<br>
Search where many squares are laid.<br>
<br>
Goof luck.
